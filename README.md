# gollop

## Objective
Gollop was made because I needed to subscribe to some AWS IoT topics and pipe messages through to a Graphite time-series DB for graphing. It is released open source for whoever else may find it useful.

## Requirements
Python 3
AWSIoTPythonSDK
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - It'll probably work on other distributions as well, though YMMV.
